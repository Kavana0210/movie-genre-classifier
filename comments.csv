"A Town Called Panic

It's a European stop motion animated film. It was originally a series of 20 shorts and then they made a feature film. It's just the story of a horse, a cowboy and an Indian (Native American) that live together. All of them look like toys and the stories that happen feel like the crazy things that a child would come up from their imagination. The animation looks cheap because it's meant to feel like a kid is actually playing with the toys. The DVD cover calls it ""Toy Story on absinthe"" which feels accurate. It's just batshit crazy but it makes you feel like a kid again because most adults minds' don't think this way when they come up with stories.

"it simply comes down to money.  Leo Dicaprio and Brad Pitt string along multiple big hits over the years with very few if any early flops so they end up with a long and successful career.  Ernie Reyes Jr, Taylor Kitsch, Taylor Lawtner, Kristen Stewart, Keira Knightly, etc. get one or a couple hit movies, studios take a chance but they don't have enough solo status to pull the box office numbers long term so they get dropped from main stream studios.  You see this a lot with ""ensemble"" films, ie. Twilight, Pirates of Caribbean where weaker actors are linked in with heavy hitters like Johnny Depp for example, and they can't hold their own in solo projects down the road.

"I don‚Äôt know, Fox put out tons of garbage in the 90‚Äôs and 00‚Äôs. There were so many shows that would run in the fall each year and disappear by December. Not just fox but they tend to put out a lot of crap. Once police procedurals and every type of reality show popped, new scripted stuff really fell off.
